## Introduction
This project aims to predict and visualize a manufacturing dataset using polynomial regression. The goal is to train a regression model to fit the data and visualize the relationship between the input features and the target variable.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `manufacturing.csv`, which contains various features related to manufacturing processes. The target variable is assumed to be one of the columns in the dataset.

## Installation
To get started with this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

The `requirements.txt` file includes the following dependencies:

- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- pandas

## Usage

1. Load the Dataset: Load the dataset from manufacturing.csv.
2. Preprocess the Data: Preprocess the dataset (e.g., handle missing values, encode categorical variables, etc.).
3. Train the Model: Train a polynomial regression model using the preprocessed data.
4. Visualize the Results: Plot the best fit line and the scatter plot of the original data.
